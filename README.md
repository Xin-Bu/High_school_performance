## High school performance
### Dataset
The data were collected from three high schools in the US, consisting of information on the students' performance in three continuous outcome variables: math, reading, and writing, as well as five predictors: their demographic information on gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course .

The R code for data visualization, descriptive statistics, and multi-linear regression was written in R Markdown and knitted to html.
#### Variables:
* Math score: The student's score on a standardized mathematics test, a continuous variable
* Reading score: The student's score on a standardized reading test, a continuous variable
* Writing score: The student's score on a standardized writing test, a continuous variable
* Race/ethnicity: The student's racial or ethnic background (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, etc.)
* Parental level of education: The highest level of education attained by the student's parent(s) or guardian(s)
