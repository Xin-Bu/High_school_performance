## High school performance
### Description of the dataset
The data were collected from three high schools in the US, consisting of information on the students' performance in math, reading, and writing which are continuous outcome variables. The students' demographic information including gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course are categorical variables as well as predictors in this project.

The R code for data visualization, descriptive statistics, and multi-linear regression was written in R Markdown and knitted to html.
#### Variables:
* Gender: The gender of the student (male/female)
* Race/ethnicity: The student's racial or ethnic background (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, etc.)
* Parental level of education: The highest level of education attained by the student's parent(s) or guardian(s)
* Lunch: Whether the student receives free or reduced-price lunch (yes/no)
* Test preparation course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (yes/no)
* Math score: The student's score on a standardized mathematics test
* Reading score: The student's score on a standardized reading test
* Writing score: The student's score on a standardized writing test
